Welcome to PHP DeepFace, a powerful face recognition and facial attribute analysis package for PHP. With PHP DeepFace, you can effortlessly integrate cutting-edge deep learning models into your PHP applications for a wide range of face-related tasks. Here's how you can get started:

## Installation

To get started, you'll need to install the [deepface](https://github.com/serengil/deepface/tree/master#installation--) Python framework. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install deepface
```

Once you've installed deepface, you can then install the PHP adapter via Composer:

```bash
composer install astrotomic/php-deepface
```

## Configuration

Configuring PHP DeepFace is a breeze. Simply instantiate the `Astrotomic\DeepFace\DeepFace` class, and it will automatically detect your local Python executable:

```php
$deepface = new \Astrotomic\DeepFace\DeepFace();
```

If you have a specific Python version you'd like to use, you can provide the path to the Python executable as an argument:

```php
$deepface = new \Astrotomic\DeepFace\DeepFace(
    python: '/usr/bin/python3',
);
```

## Usage

PHP DeepFace provides a wide range of functionalities for face recognition and facial attribute analysis. Here are some key features:

### Build Model

You can build a deepface face recognition or facial attribute model with ease:

```php
$deepface->buildModel(\Astrotomic\DeepFace\Enums\FaceRecognitionModel::VGGFACE);
```

### Face Detection

Perform face detection and alignment using this function:

```php
$deepface->extractFaces(
  img_path: '~/test.png',
);
```

### Face Verification

Verify whether two images belong to the same person or different persons. This function calculates the similarity between facial image vectors:

```php
$deepface->verify(
  img1_path: '~/test.png',
  img2_path: '~/id.jpg',
);
```

### Face Recognition

Find identities in a database by applying verification multiple times:

```php
$deepface->find(
  img_path: '~/test.png',
  db_path: '~/db',
);
```

### Face Embeddings

Generate vector embeddings for facial images using convolutional neural networks models (To Do).

### Facial Attribute Analysis

Analyze facial attributes including age, gender, emotion, and race. This function builds convolutional neural network models to classify these attributes:

```php
$deepface->analyze(
  img_path: '~/test.png',
);
```

## Testing

Run tests to ensure everything is working as expected:

```bash
composer fix
```
